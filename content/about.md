### Hello! My name is Drew Williams.

I like to create software. I am especially interested in robotics, computer vision, as well as web applications. 

I am currently in my senior year at the University at Buffalo studying for a B.S. in Computer Science. I am looking for a full time entry level software engineering job as I graduate in May of 2020.
